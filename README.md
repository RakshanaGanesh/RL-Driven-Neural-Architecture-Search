# RL-Driven-Neural-Architecture-Search

A Streamlit-based prototype for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) that uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) controller to explore neural network architectures on MNIST dataset.

## Features

- Controller RNN samples architectures from a predefined search space
- Child models are trained and evaluated to provide rewards for the controller
- Adjustable hyperparameters including number of layers, episodes, batch size, and learning rate
- Visualization of best architecture found in each run
- Interactive Streamlit interface for easy experimentation

## Motivation

This project explores automating deep neural network design to improve efficiency and performance without manual architecture engineering. NAS combines reinforcement learning with deep learning to search complex design spaces.
